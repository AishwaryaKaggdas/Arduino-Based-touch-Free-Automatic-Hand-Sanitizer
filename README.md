# Arduino-Based-touch-Free-Automatic-Hand-Sanitizer


The Arduino-Based Touch-Free Automatic Hand Sanitizer project addresses the need for improved hygiene amid the COVID-19 pandemic by allowing users to sanitize their hands without touching the sanitizer bottle. The system uses an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04) to detect hand proximity, triggering a servomotor to dispense sanitizer and LEDs to provide visual feedback. Key components include an Arduino UNO, a breadboard, jumper wires, and LEDs. The sensor's VCC, Trig, Echo, and GND pins are connected to the Arduino, while LEDs and the servomotor are also interfaced with specific digital pins. The Servo library is utilized to control the motor, ensuring efficient sanitizer dispensing based on hand distance. The system provides feedback based on the distance: if the hand is 25-100 cm away, two LEDs blink; if closer than 25 cm, all LEDs blink and the sanitizer is dispensed. This setup is designed to maintain hygiene standards by minimizing contact with surfaces.
